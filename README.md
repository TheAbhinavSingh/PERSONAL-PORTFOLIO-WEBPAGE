*DESCRIPTION OF THIS TASK*:This project is a clean and professional-looking personal portfolio website made using just HTML and CSS. It’s designed to introduce the developer—Abhinav Singh—and showcase his skills, projects, and contact information in a simple, user-friendly way. When you first open the site, you're greeted with a navigation bar at the top that lets you jump to different sections like Home, About Me, Projects, and Contact. The “Home” section has a short intro with Abhinav’s name and a brief description of what he does—mentioning that he’s a frontend developer, Python enthusiast, and someone who works with Streamlit. Scrolling down, the “About Me” section gives a quick overview of his technical background, mentioning experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Streamlit, and MySQL. It’s written in a casual, confident tone that tells visitors he enjoys building full-stack apps and solving real-world problems through code.One of the most important parts of the site is the “Projects” section, where three featured projects are displayed in a grid layout. Each project is presented in a card-like format with a title, short description, and a link to its GitHub repository. These projects include a weather app that fetches live data, a fun rock-paper-scissors game, and a frontend project created during a program called Unschool. This section makes it easy for people visiting the site—like recruiters or collaborators—to get a quick idea of what the developer has built and explore more by clicking the links.The “Contact” section is simple but effective. It lists the developer’s email and GitHub link, giving visitors easy ways to reach out or check out more of his work. At the bottom of the page, there’s a footer with a copyright notice, giving the site a nice, polished finish. The overall design is clean and modern. The CSS adds some great visual touches, like a dark-colored navbar, a light blue background for the home section, and soft shadows around the project cards. The layout adjusts well to different screen sizes, so it works on both desktops and mobile devices. Buttons and links have subtle hover effects, which make the site feel more interactive and polished even without using JavaScript.In short, this portfolio site does exactly what it’s supposed to do—it introduces Abhinav, shows off his skills and projects, and gives people a way to contact him. It’s simple, fast, and well-structured, making it perfect for an internship or job application. Even though it doesn’t include complex features like a quiz or contact form yet, it’s a solid base that can easily be expanded in the future. It shows that the developer understands how to structure a webpage, write clean HTML, apply effective styling with CSS, and organize content in a way that's easy to navigate.
